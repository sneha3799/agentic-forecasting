"""Fetch and cache FRED economic series relevant to food price forecasting.

This script downloads a curated set of FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
series that serve as exogenous covariates for the Canada's Food Price Report
(CFPR) forecasting experiment.  It registers them in a ``DataService`` for
validation and prints a summary of what was fetched.

The series are cached in memory only during this validation run; actual
experiment notebooks create their own ``DataService`` and call ``FREDAdapter``
directly, using the FRED REST API each time (no local FRED cache exists at
this stage — see technical-design.md for the planned ``FREDAdapter``
caching extension).

**Prerequisite:** Set ``FRED_API_KEY`` in your environment (or in ``.env``)::

    export FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here

Obtain a free key at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html.

Usage
-----
    uv run python scripts/fetch_fred.py

Output
------
Prints a summary table of all registered FRED series (series_id, date range,
number of observations).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FRED series catalogue for food price forecasting
#
# Each entry: (series_id, fred_series_id, description, units)
#
# Rationale for inclusion:
#   - US food CPI sub-indices: US prices transmit to Canadian food costs
#     through trade and supply chains, especially for commodities.
#   - Canadian 10-year bond yield: measures cost of capital and credit
#     conditions affecting food production and distribution.
#   - Canada/US exchange rate: direct pass-through to import food prices.
#   - S&P 100 Volatility (VXO): broad proxy for financial market uncertainty,
#     correlated with commodity price volatility.
#   - Wilshire 5000: broad US equity index as a leading economic indicator.
