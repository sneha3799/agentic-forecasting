# Agentic Forecasting

A foundation for building, evaluating, and comparing forecasting systems — conventional numerical models, LLM Processes, and agentic forecasters — on real economic, financial, and event-prediction tasks.

The repository pairs a small, stable core library with a set of self-contained reference implementations. The library gives you cutoff-safe data handling, a single `Predictor` interface, and a backtest/evaluation harness. Each reference implementation is a worked example of a different forecasting problem and the techniques that suit it. Start from whichever one is closest to what you want to build.

> **👉 First time here? Run the environment check.** After `uv sync` (see [Setup](#setup)), open [`implementations/getting_started/00_environment_check.ipynb`](implementations/getting_started/00_environment_check.ipynb) and run it top to bottom. It's a self-guided preflight that verifies every capability — proxy LLM inference, Langfuse, E2B code execution, StatCan/FRED data access, and an end-to-end mini backtest — and tells you exactly what to fix when something isn't set up. **Do this before anything else.**

## What's here

- **Core library** — `aieng-forecasting` (`aieng.forecasting`): data services, cutoff enforcement, forecasting tasks, prediction payloads, backtesting, evaluation, and artifacts.
- **Reusable methods** — `aieng.forecasting.methods`: `Predictor` implementations including naive baselines (continuous, binary, and categorical), Darts numerical predictors, LLM-process predictors (continuous, binary-probability, and categorical-probability), and ADK-based agentic infrastructure (`build_adk_agent`, `AdkTextRunner`, `AgentPredictor`).
- **Reference implementations** — `implementations/<use-case>/`: notebooks, helper modules, task-specific configuration, and co-located YAML specs.
- **Tracing** — Langfuse / OpenTelemetry bootstrap (`aieng.forecasting.langfuse_tracing`) for LiteLLM and Google ADK.
- **Data scripts** — `scripts/`: one fetch script per data source, plus `build_e2b_template.py` for the agentic code-execution sandbox.

## Two ways to use a forecaster

Every method can be used in one of two modes, and the distinction runs through the library:

- **Track 1 — evaluated prediction.** Numerical methods, LLM Processes, and agentic forecasters emit standardized `Prediction` objects and are compared head-to-head with the evaluation harness (CRPS, Brier, RPS, calibration).
- **Track 2 — interactive analysis.** The same agents can do scenario analysis, monitoring, open-ended Q&A, code-backed analysis, and reasoning over evidence — useful work that isn't reduced to a single score.

## Reference implementations

Each is independent and self-contained — pick the one that matches the problem you care about, and read that directory's `README.md` for the full walkthrough. They are numbered in a recommended order that mirrors the bootcamp progression — conventional numerical methods → LLM Processes → agents → agentic evaluation — but any one stands on its own, so jump straight to the problem you care about.

**Start here → #0 [`getting_started/`](implementations/getting_started/)** — one CPI series, one month ahead. The smallest end-to-end loop: a `Predictor`, a `BacktestSpec` and `EvalSpec`, naive + AutoARIMA baselines, CRPS scoring. The place to learn the evaluation framework before picking a domain below.

**Not sure where to start building?** Each of the four domain implementations above ends with a `99_starter_agent.ipynb` — a fresh, hackable **starter agent** (a `starter_agent/` module) with toggleable news search and code execution, two lightweight tool-usage skills, an interactive cell, and one scored forecast. It's the consistent "continue from here" entry point for taking any reference use case in an agentic direction, and a quick end-to-end test of that use case's agent stack.

## Time Series Data sources

- **StatCan** — Canadian CPI and related macroeconomic series.
- **FRED** — macroeconomic and commodity series.
- **yfinance** — equities, indices, and commodity futures.

Historical data is cached locally under `data/` and is not committed. Each implementation's README names the fetch script(s) it needs.

### FRED API key

Several reference implementations (S&P 500, BoC rate decisions) fetch data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, which requires a free personal API key. **We cannot provide this key for you** — each participant must request their own at:

> [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)

FRED keys are free and approval is typically quick, but it can occasionally take some time, so request yours early. When asked for a use-case description, something extended from the following works well:

> "Requesting an API key to explore the effectiveness of various forecasting techniques on economic data."

Once you have the key, add it to your repo-root `.env`:

```
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key
```

On Coder workspaces, bootcamp keys (`OPENAI_*`, `E2B_*`, `LANGFUSE_*`) live in your shell environment — **not** in repo `.env`. See [Bootcamp environment](#bootcamp-environment-coder).

## Repository layout

```text
aieng-forecasting/   # Installable library: import as aieng.forecasting
implementations/     # Self-contained reference implementations + co-located specs
scripts/             # Data-fetch scripts + E2B template builder
tests/               # Onboarding integration tests (not run in CI)
planning-docs/       # Architecture notes and the extension/roadmap catalog
playground/          # Exploration and archived demos (not reference implementations)
```

## Setup

Install dependencies from the repo root:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>. # If running locally. Coder environment setup clones repo automatically.
cd agentic-forecasting
uv sync --dev
```

**macOS — LightGBM and OpenMP.** The library depends on **LightGBM** (used by `DartsLightGBMPredictor` and some notebooks). The PyPI wheel expects **OpenMP** at runtime. If you see `Library not loaded: @rpath/libomp.dylib` when importing or training, install Homebrew's OpenMP once and restart your shell or Jupyter kernel:

```bash
brew install libomp
```

On Apple Silicon the dylib is typically under `/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib/`; on Intel Homebrew, `/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib/`.

### Coder Workspaces

When you open a **Coder workspace**, startup runs automatically in the background. By the time you connect you should have:

- The repo cloned, a Python venv, and dependencies installed
- Bootcamp API keys (`OPENAI_*`, `E2B_*`, `LANGFUSE_*`) available in your shell (not in `.env`)
- A shell that opens in the repo with the venv activated

**Your next step:** run [`00_environment_check.ipynb`](implementations/getting_started/00_environment_check.ipynb) top to bottom. That notebook will confirm that startup succeeded.

On first boot, keys are verified against live services and your onboarding status is recorded. Workspace restarts reload keys without re-running the full test suite.

**Local machine or troubleshooting** — fetch and verify keys manually:

```bash
eval "$(onboard --bootcamp-name agentic-forecasting --test-script tests/test_integration.py)"
```

Reload keys in a new shell without re-testing:

```bash
eval "$(onboard --bootcamp-name agentic-forecasting --skip-test)"
```

Headless verification (same checks as first-boot onboarding):

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev --all-packages
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

**Credential model:** bootcamp keys live in your shell environment. Optional personal keys (e.g. `FRED_API_KEY`) go in a `.env` only — see [`.env.example`](.env.example).

### Verify your environment first

New to the project? Open [`implementations/getting_started/00_environment_check.ipynb`](implementations/getting_started/00_environment_check.ipynb) and run it top to bottom. It's a self-guided preflight that checks every major capability — proxy LLM inference, Langfuse, E2B code execution, StatCan/FRED data access, and a full end-to-end mini backtest — one cell at a time, and tells you exactly what to fix when something isn't set up (most often a missing or placeholder key in your `.env`). It's the fastest way to confirm setup before working through the reference implementations.

### Populate the data cache

Data is fetched once and cached locally (gitignored). Each implementation names the fetch script(s) it needs in its own `README.md` — for example `scripts/fetch_cpi.py` (getting started), `scripts/fetch_sp500_market.py` + `scripts/fetch_fred.py` (S&P 500), `scripts/fetch_wti.py` (energy), and `scripts/fetch_boc.py` and `scripts/fetch_boc_press_releases.py` (BoC). Run the relevant one before opening that implementation's notebooks:

```bash
uv run python scripts/fetch_cpi.py
```

### Build the E2B sandbox image (agentic implementations only)

Agentic forecasters can run code in an E2B cloud sandbox. Credentials for e2b should be automatically injected into the environment for bootcamp participants, and you can confirm successful setup by running [`00_environment_check.ipynb`](implementations/getting_started/00_environment_check.ipynb).

If this was unsuccessful, or if you prefer to run with E2B in an alternative environment, do this once before enabling code execution in `build_adk_agent`:

1. Create a free account at [e2b.dev](https://e2b.dev) and copy your API key.
2. Add it to your `.env` file alongside the other keys (see `.env.example`):

  ```
   E2B_API_KEY=your_e2b_api_key
  ```

1. Build the template (takes a few minutes on first run):

  ```bash
   uv run --env-file .env scripts/build_e2b_template.py
  ```

The template name is the default in `CodeExecutionConfig.template_name`, so notebooks pick it up automatically.

## Core concepts

`Predictor` is the interface every forecasting method implements:

```python
class MyPredictor(Predictor):
    @property
    def predictor_id(self) -> str:
        return "my_predictor"

    def predict(self, task: ForecastingTask, context: ForecastContext) -> list[Prediction]:
        series = context.get_series(task.target_series_id)
        ...
        return [Prediction(...)]
```

`ForecastContext` is cutoff-scoped. Predictors only see observations available as of the forecast origin, which keeps backtests honest.

`backtest()` is the open iteration loop against historical data. `evaluate()` is the budgeted protected-window loop.

## Extending the foundation

This repo is a starting point, not a finished product. The shape of a new forecaster is always the same: implement `Predictor`, declare a spec, and run `backtest()` / `evaluate()` to compare it against the baselines. Each reference implementation's README ends with concrete extension ideas; `planning-docs/roadmap.md` collects the cross-cutting ones (new data sources, additional methods, live forecasting, deeper agent work).

## Code quality

```bash
make lint
make format
```

`make lint` runs the expected pre-push quality checks. Git commits do not run hooks locally. To mirror the full pre-commit suite, run:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
