# Agentic Forecasting

A research and learning platform for experimenting with forecasting agents on real-world economic, financial, and event prediction tasks. Built for the **Agentic Forecasting Bootcamp**.

---

## What this is

This repository provides the infrastructure and reference implementations for a bootcamp that teaches participants to build, evaluate, and compare forecasting systems across four paradigms:

- **Numerical forecasters** — statistical and ML models (ARIMA, gradient boosting, deep learning, time-series foundation models) applied to continuous series
- **LLM Processes** — probabilistic forecasts conditioned on historical observations *and* natural language context, using the LLM itself as the forecasting engine
- **Frontier agentic forecasters** — LLM-driven agents that invoke numerical methods as skills, retrieve context, and reason over evidence before emitting a structured prediction
- **Discrete event forecasters** — probability estimates for binary/categorical outcomes (e.g. policy-decision questions), treated as information retrieval and reasoning problems

A central objective is empirical comparison across methods on shared, standardized datasets (**Track 1**). A secondary, capability-only track (**Track 2**) showcases extended agent behaviour — scenario analysis, monitoring, open-ended Q&A — without building a new evaluation framework for it. The bootcamp's centrepiece is the **convergence**: a single flagship agent exercised in both modes on two reference experiments — Energy Commodity Prices (topical, current-events-driven) and the S&P 500 (liquid-market equities). One agent, two modes, two surfaces. The backtest/eval infrastructure is identical for Track 1 backtesting and live evaluation — the same interfaces, the same scoring, the same result format.

### Data sources

- **StatCan** — Canadian macroeconomic indicators (CPI, employment, trade)
- **FRED** — US and international macroeconomic series; commodity prices (WTI, Brent crude, inventories, exchange rates)
- **yfinance** — equities, indices, and commodity futures

Scope is intentionally narrow. See `planning-docs/bootcamp-project-charter.md` for the full set of reference experiments and the rationale for dataset selection.

## Getting started

### 1. Clone and sync dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd agentic-forecasting
uv sync --group dev
```

### 2. Populate the data cache

Data is fetched once and cached locally (gitignored). Run the relevant script before opening notebooks:

```bash
uv run python scripts/fetch_cpi.py   # StatCan CPI — 47 Canada-wide series
```

### 3. Open an experiment

Each use case under `implementations/experiments/` has a `README.md` with a recommended learning path.

- **Start here:** `implementations/experiments/getting_started/` — the hello-world tour. Single series (CPI gasoline), 12-month horizon, naive + AutoARIMA baselines, one `BacktestSpec`, one `EvalSpec`. The smallest useful end-to-end walkthrough of the evaluation framework.
- **Graduate to:** `implementations/experiments/food_price_forecasting/` — the CFPR reference experiment, flagship of the no-futures multivariate case. Nine correlated CPI sub-indices, a 12-step trajectory, the avg/avg YoY metric from the real Canada's Food Price Report, helper modules for analysis and plotting, and cached artefacts for fast iteration.
- **Look ahead to:** the bootcamp centrepiece — the Track 1 + Track 2 convergence on Energy Commodity Prices and the S&P 500. See `planning-docs/bootcamp-project-charter.md` for the framing and the full map of reference experiments.

## Core concepts

**`Predictor` ABC** — the single interface all forecasting models implement, whether statistical, ML, or agentic:

```python
class MyPredictor(Predictor):
    @property
    def predictor_id(self) -> str:
        return "my_predictor"

    def predict(self, task: ForecastingTask, context: ForecastContext) -> Prediction:
        series = context.get_series(task.target_series_id)  # cut off at context.as_of
        ...
        return Prediction(...)
```

**`ForecastContext`** — a read-only, cutoff-scoped data view passed to every predictor. All series data is automatically filtered to `context.as_of`, the forecast origin date, making information leakage structurally impossible.

**Backtesting vs eval** — `backtest()` runs freely against the full historical window; `evaluate()` runs against a short protected window with a spend budget (`max_runs`). The split mirrors Kaggle's public/private leaderboard — iterate freely on backtest, spend eval runs deliberately.

```python
from aieng.forecasting.evaluation import backtest, BacktestSpec
import yaml

with open("reference_specs/cpi_gasoline_12m.yaml") as f:
    spec = BacktestSpec.model_validate(yaml.safe_load(f))

result = backtest(predictor=my_predictor, spec=spec, data_service=svc)
print(f"Mean CRPS: {result.mean_crps:.4f}")
```

## Code quality

```bash
make lint        # Full CI suite: ruff format + ruff check + mypy + pre-commit hooks
make format      # Format only (ruff format + isort), no mypy
```

A passing `make lint` means CI will accept the code. Strict **mypy** applies to the `aieng` package; `scripts/` and `implementations/` are linted but not typechecked.
